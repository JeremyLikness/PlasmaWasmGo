# Plasma in Go and WebAssembly

[![Build Status](https://jeremylikness.visualstudio.com/PlasmaWasmGo/_apis/build/status/JeremyLikness.PlasmaWasmGo?branchName=master)](https://jeremylikness.visualstudio.com/PlasmaWasmGo/_build/latest?definitionId=11&branchName=master)

This is a simple experiment to look at WASM performance vs. plain JavaScript. It is inspired by [this plasma effect](https://jsfiddle.net/jeremylikness/bVY6t/). After building this, I fixed a bug and improved the performance of the JavaScript-only version [here](https://jsfiddle.net/jeremylikness/1xfh3c25/).

> This repository is continuously built and deployed using free Azure Pipelines.

## Instructions

I assume you have [Go](https://golang.org) installed. The link will provide instructions. This was most recently built and tested with version 1.12 on a windows/amd64 device.

If you need to run a local server, launch:

`go run goserve.go`

To compile the plasma code:

`GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o plasma.wasm plasma.go`

Then navigate to:

`http://localhost:8080`
